For the PyBank analysis, logic went a like this

Find and print/create text file of-

-The "Total Months", the count of column A

-The "Total", the sum of numerical values in column b
 
-The "Average Change", the average of numerical values in Column B

-The "Greatest Increase in Profits" over the entire period, the greatest value of column b and its corresponding Column A value. generated as "'Column A value' ('column b value')"

-The "Greatest Decrease in Profits" over the entire period, the lowest value of column b and its corresponding column A value. generated as "'Column A value' ('column b value')"


For the PyPoll analysis, the logic was

Find and print/create text file of-

-The "Total Votes", which is the count of column A

-A list of the unique values of column C, followed by the percentage of the total number of column c values, followed by the unique values count
 
-"Winner", the unique Column C value with the highest count

Notes- I did notice that the PyBank analysis seemed to have returned a different Greatest Increase and Decrease than what was shown in the module, but visually going through the data my result seemed to be correct. I am not positive, but I think the download link gave me a shortened file
